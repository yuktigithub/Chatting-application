# Chatting Application
## Overview
This project is a Chatting Application developed using Java (Swing and AWT) for the user interface and Socket Programming for the communication between clients and the server. The application allows users to connect over a network and exchange messages in real-time, simulating a basic chat environment.

## Features
1. User Interface:
- Chat Window: A simple and intuitive interface for sending and receiving messages.
  2. Real-Time Messaging:
- One-to-One Chat: Users can communicate directly with another user.
- Broadcast Messages: Messages can be broadcast to all connected users.
3. Networking:

- Client-Server Architecture: The application uses a server to manage connections and message forwarding between clients.
- Socket Programming: Ensures real-time communication over the network.
4. User Experience:
- Messages are displayed in a chat window with timestamps.
  
## Technologies Used
- Java: Core application logic
- Swing & AWT: For building the graphical user interface
- Socket Programming: For enabling communication between clients and the server
